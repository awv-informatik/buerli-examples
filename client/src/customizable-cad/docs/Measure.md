## Measure documentation

The measure plugin allows interactive measuring of the model in the 3d canvas. Use selectors to define what elements you want to measure. The system checks if combinations of selected elements can be measured as well. For certain analytic surfaces, the data is passed from server to client so that measuring is completely handled on the client.
