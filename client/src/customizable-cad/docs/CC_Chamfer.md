## Chamfer documentation

Adds a chamfer on one or more solid edges. You specify the corner appearance and select edges individually or as part of a chain. All chamfers created in a single operation are one feature.

### construction methods

1. Equal Distance: Creates a chamfer with the same offset distance from the edge on both faces.
2. Two Distances: Creates a chamfer on a single edge with a specified distance for each face. Edgedirection determines, which distance bel√∂ngs to which face. But You can easily flip the two distances.
3. Distance and angle: Creates a chamfer defined by an offset from an edge and an angle from one face to the offset.
