# Solid based modeling

Is a simple and intuitive javascript based api that incorporates solid operations like shapes, booleans (unions, subtracts, intersections), extrusions, revolves, blends, chamfers, slices, arrays, patterns, offsets, etc. The api is compatible with THREEJS and understands some of its primitives like curves and paths.
