# buerli examples

Examples that show what buerli and ClassCAD can do.

More information and documentation can be found at [buerli.io](https://buerli.io/).

## Getting Started

### ClassCAD Server

First of all you need a running ClassCAD Server, which offers the CAD service via WebSocket. In the subdirectory `./server` you can find the corresponding template of an npm package.

How to start the [server](./server/README.md).

### Client

If the ClassCAD server is up, you are ready to start building cool CAD web apps!

The client bundles the different use cases into one npm package. The project is located in the subfolder `./client`.

How to start the [client](./client/README.md).
