# buerli examples

This repository contains examples to describe how to work with buerli/ClassCAD.

## Getting Started

### ClassCAD Server

First of all you need a running ClassCAD Server, which offers the CAD service via WebSocket. In the subdirectory `./server` you can find the corresponding template of an npm package.

[Please have a look at the server package](./server).

### Client

If the ClassCAD server is up, you are ready to start building cool CAD web apps!
